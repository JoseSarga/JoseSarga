**MY PORTFOLIO**

I’m a data science professional with 3+ years of experience turning raw data into meaningful insights that drive business decisions. I love solving complex problems, whether it’s through predictive modeling, statistical analysis, or data visualization. With a strong background in Python, SQL, Tableau, and AWS, I’ve worked with both Fortune 500 companies and startups, helping them make sense of their data and optimize performance. I’m passionate about uncovering trends, improving efficiency, and making data more accessible to everyone.
